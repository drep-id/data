When I first saw Satoshi's whitepaper, I thought the world would change in a way that was similar to the way text, images, music and video changed the world. I was wrong. At the time I saw peer to peer clearly but I did not see a need to get involved. There were/are smarter and faster humans working the plan. Getting involved in governance actions has become more relevant. \\n\\nI've since learned that the complex nature of backing freedom with math is essential. The complexities require a deep academic approach Mathematics and engineering that needed to sustain success across all disciplines. \\n\\nI'm also motivated to see Cardano's approach catalyze the rest of the world into action without harm or financial retribution for one's beliefs. By becoming a DRep, I hope to be a sensible vote for those who cannot, for whatever reason, vote.","objectives":"My objectives are to learn, educate and vote sensibly. \\n1. Learn - I will read proposals that strike me as capable of providing economic identity to the billions who lack it by providing decentralized applications to manage identity, value and governance.\\n2. Educate - I will use my teaching experience to share facts that can shift perspectives towards understanding the needs and benefits to consumers.\\n3. Voting Sensibly - To me, this means using my analytical ability to stay open to new ideas, distill relevant concepts, discern facts, lean on my personal intuition when necessary and vote accordingly.\\n\\nI will not always get it right. But I will ask experts and use my experience to try and get it right or abstain.","paymentAddress":"","qualifications":"A. Software engineer in the 90's with a focus on emergent tech. Taught approx. 8,000 students how to use Macromedia and Adobe products in the Apple Mktg Ctr, Boston.\\nB. Treehouse builder, close to nature, rituals, a fair amount of discipline. Vipassana student.\\nC. Local (Hawaii State/County) involvement in politics. Platform builder, campaign manager and most often an advocate for women in politics.\\nD. Wrote and delivered grants at county and state level. SBA Home-based Business Champion recipient for the state.\\nE. Patient Advocate and Cannabis grower. Zero compensation. Caregiver.  \\nF. 20+ years of living in a remote rainforest has helped me understand the interconnectedness of all things. Off-grid.\\nG. Ability to listen intently, gather facts from varied sources and when necessary stand up to seemingly insurmountable odds and take action.\\n\\nI don't have all the experience I need but I have failed many times at many things. I remain unstoppable in my pursuits.","nationality":"Nepal","email":"josephranamgr7@gmail.com","references":[{"@type":"Link","label":"X/Twitter","uri":"https://x.com/qwerqwerqwer.com"},{"@type":"Link","label":"LinkedIn","uri":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/https://www.linkedin.com/in/joseph-rana-009319288/"},{"@type":"Link","label":"Instagram","uri":"https://www.instagram.com/joseph_rana11"}]}}
